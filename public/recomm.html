<p></p>
<p><b><span>Gallbladder Recommendations - </span></b><span>Let’s chat about your gallbladder. First things first, the medical community has led everyone astray with gallbladder issues by convincing them that dietary fat is the enemy. <br/><br/> The truth is, healthy fats are absolutely essential for every single function in every single cell in the human body! <br/><br/> When the gallbladder is removed, the answer is not to avoid high-fat foods… not even a little bit. <br/><br/> All that is happening is your body can no longer regulate bile acids to digest fatty acids properly. <br/><br/> Rather than avoiding dietary fat, the simple answer is to give your body back the bile that it needs. It seems logical, right? <br/><br/> In all of my experience with thousands of clients, these are hands-down the best digestive enzymes I've ever seen, and I recommend them to anyone who has had their gallbladder removed.</span></p>

<p>Remember, giving up fat is simply not an option. Because without it, you die. That’s a fact. It is an essential nutrient.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b><span>Metabolic Syndrome/Diabetes - </span></b><span>When a client is dealing with Metabolic Syndrome, Prediabetes, or Type 2 Diabetes, I like to take a quick moment to assure them that this program is safe for them. Now, of course, I am not a Medical Doctor and this is not medical advice but you can easily do some research on the efficacy of moderate to low-carb diets for the treatment and even reversal of these issues. </span><span><a href="https://chriskresser.com/functional-medicine-and-diabetes-how-to-treat-the-root-cause/"><b><i><span style="color: #1155cc;">Here is a great article to get you started</span></i></b></a></span> </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><span>Leaky Gut Recommendations - </span></b><span>It is my firm belief, after years of researching and working with clients, that inflammation and leaky gut are at the root of all disease, including autoimmune conditions. Whenever these issues are present in a client, we need to address the root cause: <b><i>Leaky Gut. </i></b> <br/> <br/> We will work together to strengthen the lining of your gut and improve overall gut health. I highly suggest you check out my YouTube playlist </span> <span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Montserrat; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yrck37PDp7c&list=PLO6-TwX8IKaNRMbGjQZA_ud9nWQ-wiHGE"><b> <span style="color: #1155cc;"> Back to Basics: Lectins and Leaky Gut </span></b></a> to learn more about Leaky Gut. It is critical that we decrease systemic inflammation in the body if we want to achieve optimal health and prevent chronic disease, particularly as we age. I recommend trying the following supplements together for at least the next 90 days: <b> </b></span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><b><span>Microbiome Recommendations - </span></b><span>A number of incidents throughout our lives tend to give us the short end of the stick in terms of overall gut health and immune system strength. <br/> <br/> The most common are c-section births, overprescribing of antibiotics, or even being formula fed instead of breastfeeding. <br/> <br/> It’s unfortunate, sure, but that doesn’t mean we're helpless and doomed to a life of poor gut health. All we have to do is kick start our gut health using carefully selected supplements. <br/> <br/> I recommend trying the following supplements together for the next 90 days: </span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><b><span>Alcohol Recommendations - </span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Montserrat;"> I enjoy alcohol as much as the next guy! In a social setting, with great company, there’s nothing quite like a drink or two to enhance the experience, loosen people up, and get the most memorable conversations going! I get it... but that doesn’t mean it’s good for us. <br/> <br/> There’s just no way around the fact that alcohol is a toxin. I highly recommend to give up alcohol for the first 30 days of your Clovis plan to help ensure optimal results. <br/> <br/> That said, if you choose to continue drinking (responsibly, of course!), you want to mitigate the damage as much as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Here are some quick tips: <br/> <br/> - Choose distilled liquors such as vodka, gin, or 100% Agave silver tequila. <br/> <br/> - Only use water or soda water as mixers. <br/> <br/> - Do not use sugary drinks such as pre-mixed margarita syrups, tonic water, or soft drinks! <br/> <br/> - Do not drink sweet wines. In fact, I would give up wine altogether unless you’re drinking Dry Farm Wines, which I will detail in a moment. <br/> <br/> American wines contain over 76 known carcinogens (cancer-causing agents) that are banned in European wines. For that reason, Dry Farm Wines are the only wines I recommend: </span></p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> - Sugar-Free <br/> <br/> - Low Alcohol <br/> <br/> - Naturally Grown, Naturally Made                  </span></p>
<p><span>The Founders of Dry Farm Wines are close personal friends and I believe in their mission whole-heartedly! <br/><br/> In fact, the <b><i>only </i></b>alcohol you will ever find in my home is Dry Farm Wines, that’s how much of a game-changer their wines have been in my life! </span> <span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Montserrat; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> </span></p>

<p><span></span></p>
<p><b><span>Bacterial Overgrowth - </span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Montserrat;">Any time a client is suffering from bacterial overgrowth, I recommend my <span class="SpellE">LowFODMAP</span> Plan </span> <br/> <br/> <span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FF_QFDDyenGlxrCTD0zcIsvAQl6o4jOM/view?usp=sharing"><b><i><span style="color: #1155cc;">- Click Here for your Clovis Low FODMAP Approved Foods List</span></i></b></a> </span></p>

<p><span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><span>Gastric Bypass - </span></b><span>This type of procedure can complicate things a bit in the early days of your Clovis journey. I can pretty much guarantee this plan is going to seem like way more food than you are used to eating. That is true... <b>and it is also 100% necessary.</b> Let me explain... <br/><br/> There is a giant misconception that "eating fewer calories = more weight loss." Nothing could be further from the truth. That tells "part" of the story, but it doesn't tell the whole story. <br/><br/> Believe it or not, oftentimes, overweight individuals are chronically under-eating by a significant amount. This lowers their body's natural Basal Metabolic Rate, which means the body starts to shut down certain processes, entering a sort of "starvation mode." This assuredly leads to the storage of even more body fat, even though fewer calories are being consumed. <br/><br/> This is the primary reason why very few people successfully keep the weight off, long term, after bypass surgery. It is unfortunate that the medical mainstream leads people astray here with bad information but it is critically important that you understand the importance of overall food intake. <br/><br/> The truth is, being overweight is metabolically expensive. In order for the body to function properly, in a healthy way, it will require far more calories than that of an individual at ideal body weight. <br/><br/> The bottom line is, we need to get you back to eating a healthy amount of food each day! <br/><br/> In the beginning, you may struggle to hit these macros, and that is okay! <b>The goal here is improvement, not perfection.</b> You can take as long as you need to here! See how you do Week 1 and slowly increase your food intake over time to hit these macros.</span></p>
