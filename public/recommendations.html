    <b>Leaky Gut Recommendations - </b>
        It is my firm belief, after years of researching and working with clients, that inflammation and leaky gut are at the root of all disease, 
        including autoimmune conditions. Whenever these issues are present in a client, we need to address the root cause: <b><i>Leaky Gut. </i></b> <br/> <br/> 
        We will work together to strengthen the lining of your gut and improve overall gut health. I highly suggest you check out my YouTube playlist 
        <span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Montserrat; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">

        <span style="color: #1155cc;"> Back to Basics: Lectins and Leaky Gut </span></b></a> to learn more about Leaky Gut. 
        It is critical that we decrease systemic inflammation in the body if we want to achieve optimal health and prevent chronic disease, particularly as we age. 
        I recommend trying the following supplements together for at least the next 90 days: <b> </b></span></p>

    <b>Microbiome Recommendations - </b>
        A number of incidents throughout our lives tend to give us the short end of the stick in terms of overall gut health and immune system strength. <br/> <br/>
         The most common are c-section births, overprescribing of antibiotics, or even being formula fed instead of breastfeeding. <br/> <br/> 
         It’s unfortunate, sure, but that doesn’t mean we're helpless and doomed to a life of poor gut health. All we have to do is kick start our gut health using 
         carefully selected supplements. <br/> <br/> 
         I recommend trying the following supplements together for the next 90 days:

<!-- Here starts code block for alcohol text recommendations -->
       


<p>
    <b>Alcohol Recommendations - </b>
    <span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Montserrat;"> I enjoy alcohol as much as the next guy! In a social setting, with great company, 
        there’s nothing quite like a drink or two to enhance the experience, loosen people up, and get the most memorable conversations going! I get it... 
        but that doesn’t mean it’s good for us. <br/> <br/> 
        There’s just no way around the fact that alcohol is a toxin. I highly recommend to give up alcohol for the first 30 days of your Clovis plan to help ensure 
        optimal results. <br/> <br/> 
        That said, if you choose to continue drinking (responsibly, of course!), you want to mitigate the damage as much as possible. </span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Here are some quick tips: <br/> <br/> 
        - Choose distilled liquors such as vodka, gin, or 100% Agave silver tequila. <br/> <br/> 
        - Only use water or soda water as mixers. <br/> <br/> 
        - Do not use sugary drinks such as pre-mixed margarita syrups, tonic water, or soft drinks! <br/> <br/> 
        - Do not drink sweet wines. In fact, I would give up wine altogether unless you’re drinking Dry Farm Wines, which I will detail in a moment. <br/> <br/> 
        American wines contain over 76 known carcinogens (cancer-causing agents) that are banned in European wines. For that reason, 
        Dry Farm Wines are the only wines I recommend: </span>

<!-- Here starts approved food list for gastric bypass selected yes -->
      


<p>
    <b>Gastric Bypass -</b>
        This type of procedure can complicate things a bit in the early days of your Clovis journey. I can pretty much guarantee this plan is going to seem 
        like way more food than you are used to eating. That is true... 
        <b>and it is also 100% necessary.</b> Let me explain... <br/><br/> 
        There is a giant misconception that "eating fewer calories = more weight loss." Nothing could be further from the truth. That tells "part" of the story, 
        but it doesn't tell the whole story. <br/><br/> 
        Believe it or not, oftentimes, overweight individuals are chronically under-eating by a significant amount. 
        This lowers their body's natural Basal Metabolic Rate, which means the body starts to shut down certain processes, entering a sort of "starvation mode." 
        This assuredly leads to the storage of even more body fat, even though fewer calories are being consumed. <br/><br/> 
        This is the primary reason why very few people successfully keep the weight off, long term, after bypass surgery. 
        It is unfortunate that the medical mainstream leads people astray here with bad information but it is critically important that you understand the 
        importance of overall food intake. <br/><br/> The truth is, being overweight is metabolically expensive. In order for the body to function properly, 
        in a healthy way, it will require far more calories than that of an individual at ideal body weight. <br/><br/> 
        The bottom line is, we need to get you back to eating a healthy amount of food each day! <br/><br/> 
        In the beginning, you may struggle to hit these macros, and that is okay! <b>The goal here is improvement, not perfection.</b> 
        You can take as long as you need to here! See how you do Week 1 and slowly increase your food intake over time to hit these macros.
</p>

<br/>
          
<p>
    <b>Pregnant or Breastfeeding -</b>
    When pregnancy or breastfeeding are involved, the #1 priority becomes the health of the baby. Body composition goals such as fat loss are still a priority, 
    yes, but they can't be the #1 priority at this time. It has to take a back seat to more important things… the health and wellness of the child. 
    There's a reason many women feel depleted during this time and it is assuredly micronutrient deficiencies. 
    Most women don't eat nearly enough while breastfeeding, meaning, enough of the right foods. Such as nutrient-dense animal proteins and healthy fats. <br/><br/>
     Making sure you eat the amount of food I'm recommending is critical here. Breastfeeding alone can easily put you at a 300-600 calorie deficit each day. 
     This is why it's so important for you to eat enough food and enough nutrients. 
     This plan will help you do just that! If it feels like a lot of food, that’s because it is, and it is entirely necessary while breastfeeding. <br/><br/> 
     I promise you, no plan I ever create will cause you to gain fat. Period. It just won’t happen. Don’t be afraid of food! 
     This plan is perfect for your health and the health of your child!
