    <b>Metabolic Syndrome/Diabetes - </b>
        When a client is dealing with Metabolic Syndrome, Prediabetes, or Type 2 Diabetes, I like to take a quick moment to assure 
        them that this program is safe for them. Now, of course, I am not a Medical Doctor and this is not medical advice but one of 
        the single most powerful things you can do to improve your symptoms is removing gluten from your diet.

    <b>Leaky Gut Recommendations - </b>
        It is my firm belief, after years of researching and working with clients, that inflammation and leaky gut are at the root of all disease, 
        including autoimmune conditions. Whenever these issues are present in a client, we need to address the root cause: <b><i>Leaky Gut. </i></b> <br /> <br /> 
        We will work together to strengthen the lining of your gut and improve overall gut health. I highly suggest you check out my YouTube playlist 
        <span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Montserrat; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">

        <span style="color: #1155cc;"> Back to Basics: Lectins and Leaky Gut </span></b></a> to learn more about Leaky Gut. 
        It is critical that we decrease systemic inflammation in the body if we want to achieve optimal health and prevent chronic disease, particularly as we age. 
        I recommend trying the following supplements together for at least the next 90 days: <b> </b></span></p>

    <b>Microbiome Recommendations - </b>
        A number of incidents throughout our lives tend to give us the short end of the stick in terms of overall gut health and immune system strength. <br /> <br />
         The most common are c-section births, overprescribing of antibiotics, or even being formula fed instead of breastfeeding. <br /> <br /> 
         It’s unfortunate, sure, but that doesn’t mean we're helpless and doomed to a life of poor gut health. All we have to do is kick start our gut health using 
         carefully selected supplements. <br /> <br /> 
         I recommend trying the following supplements together for the next 90 days:

    <b>Sleep Recommendations - </b>
    <span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Montserrat;">Getting enough sleep can be tricky; trust me, 
    I know. I’ve been working as a Professional Musician for over 18 years! </span>

<p>
   I spent over 10 years of my life, never getting to bed before 4 am! It was brutal, and my body suffered tremendously. 
</p>
<p>
    If you struggle with sleep, I feel your pain, and I highly recommend adding   
    <a href="https://www.iamclovis.com/collections/clovis-daily-capsules/products/daily-serenity">
    <span style="color: #1155cc;">Daily Serenity</span>
    </a>
    to your nightly routine.

<p>
    This was an absolute game-changer for me when I started Clovis! I was playing gigs in Nashville until the early morning hours on the weekends but needed 
    to be up early on weekdays with the rest of the world to run my new business. My circadian rhythm was all out of whack and magnesium glycinate was the 
    only thing I tried that actually worked.
