    <b>Leaky Gut Recommendations - </b>
        It is my firm belief, after years of researching and working with clients, that inflammation and leaky gut are at the root of all disease, 
        including autoimmune conditions. Whenever these issues are present in a client, we need to address the root cause: <b><i>Leaky Gut. </i></b> <br/> <br/> 
        We will work together to strengthen the lining of your gut and improve overall gut health. I highly suggest you check out my YouTube playlist

        <span style="color: #1155cc;"> Back to Basics: Lectins and Leaky Gut </span></b></a> to learn more about Leaky Gut. 
        It is critical that we decrease systemic inflammation in the body if we want to achieve optimal health and prevent chronic disease, particularly as we age. 
        I recommend trying the following supplements together for at least the next 90 days: <b> </b></span></p>

    <b>Microbiome Recommendations - </b>
        A number of incidents throughout our lives tend to give us the short end of the stick in terms of overall gut health and immune system strength. <br/> <br/>
         The most common are c-section births, overprescribing of antibiotics, or even being formula fed instead of breastfeeding. <br/> <br/> 
         It’s unfortunate, sure, but that doesn’t mean we're helpless and doomed to a life of poor gut health. All we have to do is kick start our gut health using 
         carefully selected supplements. <br/> <br/>

    <b>Pregnant or Breastfeeding -</b>
    When pregnancy or breastfeeding are involved, the #1 priority becomes the health of the baby. Body composition goals such as fat loss are still a priority, 
    yes, but they can't be the #1 priority at this time. It has to take a back seat to more important things… the health and wellness of the child. 
    There's a reason many women feel depleted during this time and it is assuredly micronutrient deficiencies. 
    Most women don't eat nearly enough while breastfeeding, meaning, enough of the right foods. Such as nutrient-dense animal proteins and healthy fats. <br/><br/>
     Making sure you eat the amount of food I'm recommending is critical here. Breastfeeding alone can easily put you at a 300-600 calorie deficit each day. 
     This is why it's so important for you to eat enough food and enough nutrients. 
     This plan will help you do just that! If it feels like a lot of food, that’s because it is, and it is entirely necessary while breastfeeding. <br/><br/> 
     I promise you, no plan I ever create will cause you to gain fat. Period. It just won’t happen. Don’t be afraid of food! 
     This plan is perfect for your health and the health of your child!
